# VSCode Journal View

This extension adds an explorer viewlet (tree view) to the excellent [vscode-journal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pajoma.vscode-journal) extension allowing quick access to the journal files.

## Installing

You can install the latest version of the extension via the Visual Studio Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.vscode-journal-view).

Alternatively, open Visual Studio code, press `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P` and type:

## Known issues

Month and day names should be shown according to your locale, but ordinal indicators (st, nd, rd, etc.) are only English. If anybody knows how to do this in javascript please tell me!
